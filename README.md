1.I used the Laravel project where I was following the lecture. My assignments projects where not working well.
2. Created a branch called Laravel where I will be working on
I created API endpoints in routes/api.php

The challenging part was the time management as I have other assignments I have to hand in, so this is not completely done. However I still plan to finish for my enducation purpose
